# giridharreddyk.github.io

Source code for my personal website, [giridharreddyk.github.io](https://giridharreddyk.github.io): a portfolio covering my research interests, publications, projects and CV.

The site is a small static project written in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has no frameworks, build tooling or package dependencies, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Four content pages: home (profile, news, selected publications), publications (with BibTeX and summaries), projects (filterable cards) and a web CV
- Responsive layout with a mobile navigation menu
- Light and dark themes that follow the system preference, with a manual toggle that persists across visits
- Print stylesheet for the CV page (A4), including a QR code back to the site, which is also the source of the downloadable PDF
- Progressive enhancement: cross-fading page navigation and an animated project filter using the View Transitions API, disabled for visitors who prefer reduced motion
- Sharing and search metadata: Open Graph and Twitter cards, JSON-LD structured data (`Person`, plus `CollectionPage` lists for publications and projects), `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
- Accessibility: semantic landmarks, a skip link that moves focus, visible focus styles, contrast-checked colours, links that do not rely on colour alone and reduced-motion support
- Performance: no third-party requests, preloaded fonts with metric-matched fallbacks (no layout shift while they load), a responsive hero image and `content-visibility` on long sections

## Tech stack

- HTML5, modern CSS (custom properties, `light-dark()`, nesting, Grid, Flexbox, logical properties) and vanilla JavaScript (ES2022)
- [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) typefaces, self-hosted as WOFF2 subsets, so pages make no third-party requests
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Local development

Clone the repository and serve it with any static file server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GiridharReddyK/giridharreddyk.github.io.git
cd giridharreddyk.github.io
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. There is no build step: edit the relevant HTML, CSS or JavaScript files and reload the page. The header and footer are plain HTML repeated on each page, so navigation changes need to be applied to every page.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages publishes the root of the `main` branch. Pushing changes to `main` triggers a new deployment, and the site updates within a minute or two.
